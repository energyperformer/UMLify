GANTT CHART

Gantt Chart
A Gantt Chart, is a powerful tool used for project management. It visually represents a project
schedule, allowing managers and team members to see the start and end dates of the entire project at
a glance. The diagram displays tasks or activities along a horizontal time axis, showing the duration of
each task, their sequence, and how they overlap or run concurrently.
In a Gantt Chart, each task is represented by a bar, the length and position of which reflects the start
date, duration, and end date of the task. This format makes it easy to understand dependencies
between tasks, where one task must be completed before another can start. Additionally, Gantt Diagrams
can include milestones, which are significant events or goals in the project timeline, marked as a distinct
symbol.
In the context of creating Gantt Charts, PlantUML offers several advantages.
It provides a text-
based approach to diagram creation, making it easy to track changes using version control systems.
This approach is particularly beneficial for teams who are already accustomed to text-based coding
environments. PlantUML’s syntax for Gantt Charts is straightforward, enabling quick modifications
and updates to the project timeline. Additionally, the integration of PlantUML with other tools
and its ability to generate diagrams dynamically from text makes it a versatile choice for teams looking
to automate and streamline their project management documentation. The use of PlantUML for Gantt
Charts thus combines the clarity and eﬀiciency of visual project planning with the flexibility and
control of a text-based system.
16.1
Declaring tasks
The Gantt is described in natural language, using very simple sentences (subject-verb-complement).
Tasks defined using square bracket.
16.1.1
Workload
The workload for each task is specified using the requires verb, indicating the amount of work needed
in terms of days.
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 15 days
[Test prototype] requires 10 days
-- All example --
[Task 1 (1 day)] requires 1 day
[T2 (5 days)] requires 5 days
[T3 (1 week)] requires 1 week
[T4 (1 week and 4 days)] requires 1 week and 4 days
[T5 (2 weeks)] requires 2 weeks
@endgantt
A week is typically understood as a span of seven days. However, in contexts where certain days are
designated as ’closed’ (like weekends), a week can be redefined in terms of ’non-closed’ days. For example,
if Saturday and Sunday are marked as closed, then a week in this context will equate to a five-day
workload, corresponding to the remaining weekdays.

Definition of a week depending of closed days

@endgantt
16.16
Definition of a week depending of closed days
A week is a synonym for how many non-closed days are in a week, as:
@startgantt
Project starts 2021-03-29
[Review 01] happens at 2021-03-29
[Review 02 - 3 weeks] happens on 3 weeks after [Review 01]'s end
[Review 02 - 21 days] happens on 21 days after [Review 01]'s end
@endgantt
So if you specify Saturday and Sunday as closed, a week will be equivalent to 5 days, as:
@startgantt
Project starts 2021-03-29
saturday are closed
sunday are closed
[Review 01] happens at 2021-03-29

Simplified task succession
It’s possible to use the then keyword to denote consecutive tasks.
@startgantt
[Prototype design] requires 14 days

then [Deploy prototype] requires 6 days
@endgantt
You can also use arrow ->

Working with resources
You can affect tasks on resources using the on keyword and brackets for resource name.
