Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) diagram is a key project management tool that breaks down
a project into smaller, more manageable components or tasks. It’s essentially a hierarchical de-
composition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project
objectives and create the required deliverables.
PlantUML can be particularly useful for creating WBS diagrams. Its text-based diagramming
means that creating and updating a WBS is as straightforward as editing a text document, which is
especially beneficial for managing changes over the project’s lifecycle. This approach allows for easy
integration with version control systems, ensuring that all changes are tracked and the history of the
WBS evolution is maintained.
Moreover, PlantUML’s compatibility with various other tools enhances its utility in collaborative en-
vironments. Teams can easily integrate their WBS diagrams into broader project documentation and
management systems. The simplicity of PlantUML’s syntax allows for quick adjustments, which is crucial
in dynamic project environments where the scope and tasks may frequently change. Therefore, using
PlantUML for WBS diagrams combines the clarity of visual breakdown with the agility and control
of a text-based system, making it a valuable asset in eﬀicient project management.

* Hi =)
** sometimes i have node in wich i want to write a long text
*** this results in really huge diagram
**** of course, i can explicit split with a\nnew line
**** but it could be cool if PlantUML was able to split long lines, maybe with an option who specify
