Introduction\n\n1.1 Purpose\n\nDine(ut is an android application that aims to digitalize the process of various restaurant\nmanagement operations including ordering and inventory management and POS. This document\naims to capture the system requirements and features particularly related to ordering and\ninventory management to be implemented in DineOut version 1.0., with the later releases on\nPOS (Point of Sale).\n\n1.2 Document Conventions\n\n1.2.1 Priority Conventions\n\nIn this complete document, we will mention priority as “low” or “high” throughout the\ndocument. Secondly, priorities are only mentioned in section 4 and section 5 along with\ndetailed description of the requirements. Any high-level requirements mentioned\nelsewhere are assumed to inherit priorities of their detailed counterparts in section 4,5,\n\n1.2.2 Fonts Conventions\n\nThroughout this document, All the user entities are written in capitalizations ic, first\nletter as capital, Also, any significant term which has been described in the glossary is\nmade bold and italic in the text, On the other hand, those terms which are significant (but\nnot described in glossary) are bold im text,\n\n1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions\n\nThe purpose of this document is 10 give a detailed description of the requirements for the\n“DincOut™ software. It will illustrate the purpose, scope and complete description for the\ndevelopment of system. It will also explain external interface requirements and system\nrequirements as well as non-functional requirements. This document is primarily\nintended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and alse for further processing\nsuch as additions to be developed in later releases.\n\nCustomers can refer to section 3 and 4 for the list of requirements implemented in\nVersion 1.0. Users are advised to refer to user documentation section for tutorials and\nonline support information,\n\nThis document will also be used as a reference for developing and testing Version 1.0 by\nthe development team as well as the testers. The development team can refer to section\n2.3 and 2.6 for system level information and section 3 for system features that are to be\nimplemented in this version of the software,\n\fSoftware Requirements Specification for DireOQut Page 2\n\n1.4 Product Scope\n\nDineOut is a restaurant management system developed with the intention of automating the day\nto day tasks ina restaurant like order and inventory management, bill generation and taking\nfeedback. This release of the software would deal with these lasks only whereas more areas\nmight be automated in the future versions of this software. The main purpose is to improve the\nperformance of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks\nwould be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently, An additional benefit of this\nsoftware is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would\nperform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks\nmanually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can\nreduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would\nresult in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant, Feedback module would help the restaurant\ncheck for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the\nbilling module to see the trends in sales and profits, These benefits can potentially result in\ngeneration of more revenues for the restaurant.\n\n1.5 References\n\n1. Android User Interface 2 bape Available: at:\n\n2. IEEE. IEEE Std $30-1998 IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements\nSpecifications. IEEE Computer Society, 1998,\n\fSoftware Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 3\n\n2. Overall Description\n\nThis section will give an overview of the DineOut application. The basic functionality of the\nsystem as well ils context will be explored in detail. [t also describes different kinds of\nstakeholders and user classes associated with the system and what functionality is available for\neach class. At last, the assumptions and dependencies for the system are presented.\n\n2.1 Product Perspective\n\nDineOut app will attempt to replace the traditional manual ordering process and is a new self-\ncontained software system that consists of two parts: one mobile application and the other is\nFirebase database. The mobile application will be used for ordering and interacting with the\ninventory while the Firebase database will be used for storing the inventory and ordering related\ninformation about the food items like pending and complete order queues.\n\nThe mobile application will have five interfaces, Each for Customer, Manager, Head Chef,\nAdmin and Chef. Manager can see/edit the status of available/reserved tables. Customer's\ninterface will consist of a scrollable menu listing available items and their price. When ihe\ncustomer selects some dishes and place the order, i will be stared in “pending orders” table in\nFirebase database. Head Chef's interface will be such that he is notified of the pending order and\nhe is able to assign it to one the available queues of chefs who are then able to see the new order\nin their screens or on a central display in kitchen, After cach item/dish in an order is prepared,\nthe order is marked completed through the Head Chef's interface, the hall manager gets notified\nthrough his interface. Customer's interlace has an option for requesting the bill, Bill is printed\nthrough the Manager's interface. Admin can change and modify the Firebase database like add\nnew menus or staff, edit current inventory stock ete.\n\neal\n\no\n\nmo maREA pur Mampi Dye\n\nTotithea tions “Moeitying Inmaminy and empioyi list\n\nFirebase Catebee\n\nFigi - System Perspective Diagram\n\fSofteare Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 4\n\n2.2 Product Functions\n\nGiven below are the major functions that can be performed using DineOut app. Moreover, a Data\nFlow Diagram (BDFD) for better understanding of the system is also given in Appendix B.\n\nThe system will:\nAllow Customers to scroll through the menu and select the dishes he/she wants.\nAllow the Customers to cancel/edit the order any time before its prepared.\nAllow Customers to provide feedback regarding the food and overall service of the\nrestaurant.\n\n« Allow Customers to request for bill,\n\n« Allow Customers toask for help through the system.\n\n* Assign Head Chef to assign the dishes in an order to chefs according to their specialties.\n\n« Show dish queues and their status, for Chets.\n\n« Allow admin to perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) operations on Staff\nMembers, Menu Items and Inventory.\n\n* Allow Head Chef to mark orders complete.\n\n* Allow the Head Chef to approve cancellation of dish or order.\n\n« Allow Hall Manager to mark the bill as: paid.\n\n* Notify the Hall Manager when a particular order is complete.\n\n* Allow the Hall Manager to see/edit status of tables reserved and available and their\n\ncapacitics,\n2.3 User Classes and Characteristics\n\nThere are four types of users that interact with our system (See appendix 8), Firstly, there is a\nHall Manager, then Customer, Head Chef and Admin, We'll provide an interface for Chefs as\nwell through which they are looking at the status of their order queues, but they will mot interact\nwith our system,\n\n2.3.1 Customer Class\nCustomers interact with our system directly in order to place order, modify order, get bill and\n\ngive feedback. We do not store any information related to customers in our system. The process\nof order taking starts from customers placing order and then the other series of events begin.\n\n2.3.2 Head Chef/Kitchen Manager\n\nHead Chef can mark a dish as prepared when a chef tells him to do so. He can approve the\ncancellation of an order whenever a customer edits or removes a dish from his order. He can also\nassign a dish to a particular chef based on the specialty of the chef.\n\n2.3.3 Chef\n\fSoftware Requirements Specification for DitreQut Page §\n\nChefs don’t interact with the system. They just have to look at the dishes present in their queues\nand prepare the dishes accordingly. Chefs name, address and specialty ete. are stored in the\ndatabase,\n\n2.3.4 Admin\n\nAdmin’s job is to manage the inventory and other information related to menu and chefs in the\nsystem,\n\n2.3.5 Hall Manager\n\nHall Managers will provide its input when he marks the bill as paid when customers pay for their\norder or get the bill printed. Moreover, he gets a notification whenever a particular order is\ncomplete, or some customer asks for help through the system. Hall manager can also see tables\nin the hall and their status ic. empty or filled.\n\n24 Operating Environment\n\nItis an android application running on a tablet and the tablets are present in a restaurant. Firstly,\nTanager would be present at the entrance and system in his tab would show the tables that are\nempty/reserved. There would be a tab present at every table for customers which they will use to\ngive order, When an order is placed the server would notify the head chef? kitchen manager who\nwould be in the kitchen. Head chef would use his tab which also would have the system installed\nand would add the order to the appropriate queues of the chefs. The chefs would be present in the\nkitchen area and their interface would allow them to check for the dishes they have to prepare,\nSo, the system is running on various tablets but the operating environment and purpose of each is\ndifferent for cach user,\n\n2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints\n\n25.1 Operating System Constraint\n\nSystem should be compatible and will smoothly run on Android version 6.0 or\nabove,\n\n2.5.2 Device Constraint\n\nDineOut'’s core system and its user interfaces should be compatible with tablets.\nHowever, running on small android mobile devices is not necessary,\n\fSofhenre Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 6\n\n2.6 User Documentation\n\nThe software is accompanied by the following materials for further help:\n® User Manual Version 1.0\ne® Online support at www.dinoul.com\n\n2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies\n\nOne assumption about the software is that it will always be used on tablets that have enough\nresources to run the application. If the tablet does not have cnough hardware resources available\nfor the application, there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or\nnet even at all.\n\nThe application uses Firebase database for online storage of information like orders and menu\nitems that needs to be in working state. If the Firebase interface changes the application needs 10\nbe adjusted accordingly,\n\fSofteare Requirements Specification for DineOut Page ?\n\n=F\n\n3.1\n\n2.\n\nExternal Interface Requirements\n\nUser Interfaces\n\nCustomer Interface\n\nThe customer interface will contain three screens, All three screen will have a\nconsistent layout,\n\nLL... Place Order\nIn this screen, system shows a list of cards (UI Elements) of dishes, Each\ndish will have an image, its price per serving.\n\n1.2. Timer and Edit/Cancel Order\nAfter confirming the order, the user will be shown a timer sereen. In this\nscreen customer will be shown “Edit Order\" and “Cancel Order” buttons\nand a timer which shows the completion time of the order. There will also\nbe a button to request for bill.\n\n1.3. Feedback\nIn feedback screen, at the top right comer a button for “Request Bill” will\nbe shown. Beneath this button we will display a form which will have\ndifferent multiple-choice questions and a submit feedback button.\n\nHead Chef Interface\n\nIn head chef interface, system will show all the current orders in detail ie. all the\ndishes of a particular order, In each order, there is a button which will be used to\nmark that dish cooked. Moreover, when customer wants to remove a dish from his\norder, system will show head chef a notification to approve the removal of the\ndish.\n\nHall Manager Interface\n\nHall manager will have a screen where he will get notification whenever an order\nis completed. System will notify the hall manager about the order number and\ntable number. Hall Manager also has ‘a screen where all orders are listed, and\nstatus button to mark the order as paid. Moreover, he also has an interface screen\nto see and the status of tables in the restaurant as free/available.\n\nAdmin Interface\n\fSofteare Requirements Specification for DineOut Page &\n\n3.2\n\nAs Admin is authorized to perform CRUD operations on Staff Members, Menu Items and\n\nInventory Items, He'll be having three different sereens for Staff Members, Menu Items,\nand Inventory.\n\nHardware Interfaces\n\nOur system can interact with a hardware device directly, We have tw connect our system to the\nbill printer for handing the hard copy of the bill to the customer. For billing module, we may\nhave to use a credit card reader for payment, but the interaction and the results generated by that\nreader are just entered into our system manually by the user. Moreover, the central screen in\nkitchen which will be displaying the status of order queues.\n\n33\n\n3.4\n\nSoftware Interfaces\n\nFor Database services system shall use to Firebase latest version released on October 16,\n2018.\n\nSystem will run on android version above or cqual to marshmallow 6.0\nSystem shall use v4 support library Print Helper for connecting to the printer and\na driver to connect to the kitchen screen.\n\nCommunications Interfaces\n\nDineOut is an android application and it will communicate with Firebase (which is a storage\nserver provided by Cioogle for android developers). Firebase uses HTTP protacol for\ncommunication, so our deviee will follow HTTP protocol when connecting to Firebase.\n\fSofteare Requirements Specification for DineOut Page 9\n\n4.\n41\n\n4.1.1\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nPlace Order\nDescription and Priority\n\nThe system will give customers the ability to place their orders using our product.\nIt will display a list of available and unavailable dishes in the menu where\nunavatlable dishes will be grayed out, Customer will be able to select multiple\ndishes and their quantity for a particular order.\n\nPriority:\nhigh\n\nStimulus/Response sequences\n\nWhen user enters the order activity/page, initially system displays a list of\navailable and unavailable dishes along with their prices.\n\n1.
